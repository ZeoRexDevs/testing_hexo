A custom recovery is used for installing custom software on your device. This custom software can include smaller modifications like rooting your device or even replacing the firmware of the device with a completely custom “ROM” like LineageOS or OmniROM. Important notice I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this recovery before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you. If you have some doubts, you can ask me here Changelog For v3.2.1-0 minui fixes (cryptomilk) Better android-8.0 compatibility in ROM trees (Dees_Troy) Fix missing library in android-8.0 (nkk71) Fix inconsistent SDCard naming (DevUt) Default to TWRP restore instead of adb backup restore to fix restore on fresh TWRP boot (jlask) Downloads &amp; Device trees Device Download links Device tree Build Status Build log Huawei Honor 3C Lite Download View Working Download Acer Liquid Z500 Download View Working Download Acer Liquid Z520 Download View Working Download Lenovo A536 Download View Working Download QMobile X70 Download View Working Download Micromax Canvas Selfie Lens Q345 Download View Working Download Lava Iris X8 Download View Working Download Lenovo A328 Download View Working Download XOLO Omega 5.5 Download View Working Download Oppo Neo 7 Download View Working Download Symphony Xplorer V80 Download View Working Download HTC Desire 620G Download View Working Download Cherry Mobile Me Vibe Download View Working Download Intex Aqua Power HD Download View Working Download Prestigio MultiPhone 5504 Duo Download View Working Download Xiaomi Redmi Note 3G Download View Working Download Lenovo S860 Download View Working Download Kingzone K1 Turbo Download View Working Download LG G3 Stylus Download View Working Download HTC Desire 816G Download View Working Download Xiaomi Redmi 1S TD Download View Working Download Gionee M2 Download View Working Download Micromax Canvas Hue Download View Working Download Doogee X5 Download View Working Download Infinix Zero 2 X509 Download View Working Download Credits TeamWin Akshay Sankle Ethan Yonker aka Dees_Troy OmniROM Liquid Porting &amp; Development Vojtěch Hejsek","categories":[{"name":"blog","slug":"blog","permalink":"https://ZeoRexDevs.github.io/testing_hexo/categories/blog/"}],"tags":[]}]}
